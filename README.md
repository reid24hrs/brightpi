========

The Raspberry Pi Python Brightness Sensor runs on a Raspberry Pi. It takes a picture from a USB webcam and works out the brightness using the Python Imaging Library http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/.

Once this is done the program then tries to upload the date+time and brightness to a line in a Google Drive Spreadsheet.
